        <p>Uno is a classic card game that is easy to learn and fun for players of all ages.</p>
        <ul class="uno">
            <li>Uno is a game where players take turns matching a card from their hand with the current card shown on top of the deck.</li>
            <li>The objective is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards by playing them onto the discard pile.</li>
            <li>Players can play a card that matches the color or number of the top card, or they can play a Wild card to change the color.</li>
            <li>Uno is enjoyed for its simple rules, fast-paced gameplay, and the element of luck involved in drawing cards.</li>
            <li>Overall, Uno is a fun and engaging game that is perfect for family game nights and gatherings with friends.</li>
            <li>Uno is a game that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a lighthearted and entertaining card game experience.</li>
